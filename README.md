🚀 Zencode AI - 
V0 Clone that Transform Ideas into Website—Locked to Your Design Standards. **The Perfect Enterprise level requirements!!**

### 🌟 Why Zencode AI?
Tired of AI tools that ignore your design system? Zencode AI is V0’s disciplined cousin—it generates UI code that strictly uses your pre-approved components, colors, and npm packages.

✅ For Teams Who Care About Brand Consistency <br>
✅ No More "Oops, That’s Not Our Button" Moments <br>
✅ No More "Uggh, why is the code generator using lucide react for icons" Moments <br>

🔥 USP at a Glance
🛠️ Configure Your Design DNA
- Drop a GitHub URL? Boom—your components are now the only ones allowed.
